→ rest of the functions
	- nowequ (interpreter & lexer)
→ change syntax of 'if'
→ bugs in @defmacro............. and in @run
→ change goto. instead of rewind(in) and search from start, go back and search from right now. if not found - rewind and search from start to finish
→ fix all -Wextra warnings, fix all -O3 warnings

DONE ===============
5. @newmacro, @endmacro, @run in lexer for macros
	how?

	→ create new lexer-only data structure:
	idk,, something like 

		typedef struct LexerMacro {
			char *name;
			FILE *content;
		} LexerMacro;

	→ then add new lexer definitions
		@newmacro <name> -> get and tokenize all to @endmacro <name> and save it to LexerMacro.content (!as tmpfile!)

		@run <name> -> get name, and search for macro; print tokenized (LexerMacro.content)
