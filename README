RUNNING SCRIPTS
---------------

	turtel_lex script_name.trl -o script_name.tlx
	turtel script_name.tlx

	# or

	turtel_lex -e -o script_name script_name.trl
	./script_name


* please, oh please don't look at this spaghetti code.


KNOWN BUGS
----------

turtel_lex:
	- @include does not work
	- line numbers in errors may not be right
	- memory may leak on errors
	- gibbirish is displayed sometimes on errors
	- won't compile on windows, may not compile on BSD, won't compile on plan9

turtel:
	- won't compile on windows, may not compile on BSD, won't compile on plan9
	- __newline etc. definitions are really bad
	- is slow
	- -w is bad


if you want the funcionality of @include use a sh function like this one:

--- shell script

trl_inc_lex() {
	usage() {
		echo "usage: trl_inc_lex file.trl > file_incd.trl"
	}

	[ -z "$1" ] && usage || \
		(
			for f in `grep "@include " "$1" | awk '{ print $2 }'`
			do
				trl_inc_lex "$f"
			done

			grep -v "@include " "$1"
		)
}

---

@include will be fixed in the future, but for now that's the "correct" way to include files
